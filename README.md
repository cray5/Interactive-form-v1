---- Set focus on the first text field when the script is executed.

----”Job Role” section:-

text field that will be revealed when the "Other" option is selected from the "Job Role" drop down menu.

----”T-Shirt Info” section:-

i) Hide the "Color" label and select menu until a T-Shirt design is selected from the "Design" menu.

ii) Until a theme is selected from the “Design” menu, no color options appear in the “Color” drop down and the “Color” field reads “Please select a T-shirt theme”.

iii) For the T-Shirt "Color" menu, after a user selects a theme, only display the color options that match the design selected in the "Design" menu.
